# Odin Knights Travails

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, demonstrating how to solve the "Knight's Travails". The goal is to find the shortest possible path for a knight on a chessboard from a given starting position to a target position.

## Features

- Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore possible moves.
- Efficiently finds the shortest path using a queue to store move sequences.
- Tracks visited positions to avoid redundant calculations.

## How to Run

```bash
node bst.js
```
